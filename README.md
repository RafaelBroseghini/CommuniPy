# PyPractice :snake: :books:
This repository includes exercises for refreshing Python skills, from strings, lists to Object Oriented Programming.

## Usage
> Using Strings as an example.
* `git clone https://github.com/RafaelBroseghini/PyPractice.git`
* `cd Strings`
* *Write code for each function in strings.py*
* `python strings_test.py`

## Notes
* Unittest will test all the functions specified in test file.
* To test specific functions, comment out test cases in the test file.
* If you pass all tests no error will be thrown.
* If error is thrown it will trace back to the exact implementation where the error is coming from.
