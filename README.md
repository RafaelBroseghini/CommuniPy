# CommuniPy :snake: :books:
This repository includes exercises for refreshing Python skills, from strings, lists to Object Oriented Programming. 
* **It is also a place that provides valuable insights from real humans on real life matters. People with different backgrounds share their stories and advices on how to become a better programmer and asset in the workfoce.**

* **This is intended to be a place for everyone with any Python knowledge to contribute
and make an impact within the community. Have a problem in mind or want to share your story? Make a pull request!**



![How to Use](/CommuniPy.gif)

**See [Notes](#notes) for other usage features.**

## How it works:
CommuniPy is a place to craft your Python skills and learn from a large community with valuable insights.
* Implementation happens in the source file (reverse_string.py) within each Folder (e.g. 'Strings).
* After that, all you have to do is execute the source file.
* If you pass all tests no error will be thrown.
* If error is thrown it will trace back to the exact implementation where the error is coming from.
