# PyPractice :snake: :books:
This repository includes exercises for refreshing Python skills, from strings to Object Oriented Programming.

## Usage
> Using Strings as an example.
* `git clone https://github.com/RafaelBroseghini/PyPractice.git`
* `cd Strings`
* *Write code for each function in strings.py*
* `python strings_test.py`

## Notes
* Unittest will test all the functions from source file, to test specific functions comment out test cases in test.py file.
* If you pass all tests no error will be thrown.
* If error is thrown it will trace back to the exact implementation where the error is coming from.
